# Clinic-NET

Explainable Differential Diagnosis of Dementia using Self-supervised Learning.
The proposed method is based on Nearest-Neighbour Contrastive Learning of Visual
Representations (NNCLR) [1] using ConvNeXt Tiny [2] with 7x7 filter kernels.

The following image visualizes the whole architecture:

![Architecture](./images/architecture.png)

## Repository structure:
- `configuration` folder contains the YAML file for the configuration
- `data_processing` folder contains the methods that are used to prepare data for a model
- `models` folder defines a model structure
- `run_nnclr.py` trains the NNCLR model
- `run_classifier.py` trains the classification model
- `run_indep_eval.py` evaluates the whole model on independent data
- `run_nnclr.py` creates figures
- All output information will be saved into the working folder (see `configuration.yaml`)

## Set-up Instructions & data preparations:
- `sudo apt-get install dcm2niix`
- install ANTs: https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs/wiki/Compiling-ANTs-on-Linux-and-Mac-OS
- `pip3 install captum lightly openpyxl plotly mlxtend zennit nibabel torch_tb_profiler`
- `git clone https://github.com/VadymV/clinica` and `git clone https://github.com/VadymV/clinicadl.git`
- `pip install ./clinica ./clinicadl`
- `conda install tsnecuda -c conda-forge`
- download each dataset and place extracted image data into its own directory: 
/data/dataset_name/data/folder_with_extracted_data (e.g. /data/nifd/data/NIFD). 
Also download clinical data and place it into the clinical_data folder (e.g. /data/nifd/clinical_data). 
Of course, a symbolic link can be used instead of using the dataset directory directly (e.g. `ln -s source link`)
- follow the instructions on https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/clinica/docs/public/latest/
how to use dataset converters: e.g. 
`clinica convert nifd-to-bids [OPTIONS] DATASET_DIRECTORY CLINICAL_DATA_DIRECTORY BIDS_DIRECTORY`.
- run `clinica run t1-linear [OPTIONS] BIDS_DIRECTORY CAPS_DIRECTORY`
See also https://aramislab.paris.inria.fr/clinica/docs/public/latest/Pipelines/T1_Linear/
for more details
- extract 2D slices: 
`clinicadl extract slice CAPS_DIRECTORY t1-linear --slice_mode single --slice_direction 1 --discarded_slices 50`
- create a file that contains all required information about patients: `clinica iotools merge-tsv BIDS info_data.tsv`

## How to?
- When data are prepared the actual training of models and their evaluation can begin
- The file `info_data.tsv` is used as metadata (e.g. for data loading, split into train and test sets, creation of 
labels)
- Configurations are defined in the `configuration/configuration.yaml` file:
  - Block `data` contains settings on how to select slices and what labels to consider
  - `nnclr`, `classifier`, and `independent_evaluation` blocks are used to set parameters for 
training/evaluation and load specific dataset
- Do you want to use your own dataset? Extend the code in `clinica` and `clinicadl` libraries:
  1. Conversion to BIDS: see `clinica/clinica/iotools/converters` to imitate the same structure
  2. T1-pipeline: see `clinica/clinica/pipelines/t1_linear` if in some places additional references
  are needed, however the pipeline should not depend on additional information
  3. Extraction of slices: see `clinicadl/clinicadl/extract` if in some places additional references
  are needed, however the pipeline should not depend on additional information

## Additional info and known issues
- delete files: `find . -name '*pattern*' -exec rm {} \;`
- unzip files: `unzip "file_name*.zip" -d output_dir/`
- running out of storage place. Clinica uses tmp directory for intermediate calculations. 
If you want to provide another location, do: `export TEMP=/new_location/` or `export TMP=/new_location/` or 
`export TMPDIR=/new_location/` based on your settings
- clinicadl (version 1.0.3) requires clinica==0.4.1
- if `InvalidIndexError` occurs, insert (line 157):
    <pre>    
    
    if not merged_df.empty:
        merged_df = merged_df.append(row_df)
    else:
        merged_df = row_df.copy()
    
    </pre>

- if an error `ValueError: cannot reindex from a duplicate axis` occurs insert after line 167:
    <pre>
    merged_df = merged_df.reset_index(drop=True)
    merged_df = merged_df.loc[:, ~merged_df.columns.duplicated()]
    </pre>

- (NIFD) T1w MRI file for the subject sub-NIFD1S0017 with session ses-M00 does not exist and thus is removed
- PyCharm does not have enough space: set the variables idea.system.path=/path
idea.log.path=/data_dzne_archiv/Studien/ClinicNET/temp/log/
- `Warning: Assuming 7FE0,0010 refers to an icon not the main image`. 
This warning was ignored. Upgrade of dcm2niix did not help.
- `pandas.errors.ParserError: Expected 36 fields in line 80, saw 37`. This error occurs
while parsing the file 'aibl_flutemeta*.csv'. Fix: replace 'measured, AUSTIN AC AT Brain  H19s'
through 'measured AUSTIN AC AT Brain  H19s'.
- `File not found` error during the execution of the command ``xxxx-to-bids`.  To
overcome the termination of the process, type `continue` in a file `clinica -> utils -> inputs.py`
just before where the errors are collected: line 309 (08.02.2022, clinica=0.5.3)
- `dx1` is instead of `diagnosis` as a column name during processing of the OASIS dataset. 
Insert the following into the file `clinica/clinica/iotools/utils/data_handling.py` at the
appropriate places:

<pre>
            if 'dx1' in sessions_df.columns:
                sessions_df.rename(
                    columns={
                        "dx1": "diagnosis",
                    }, inplace=True,
                )
